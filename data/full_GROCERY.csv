Mahafruit Premium Quality Kishmish (Raisins),215.0,149.0,Dry Fruits,Mahafruit,500 gm,"Overview:Mahafruit golden seedless raisins are produced from selected Thompson seedless variety of grapes. Raisins are an excellent source of fiber, iron and also calcium. Raisins are also good for the eyes and help to prevent muscular degeneration.Key FeaturesNatural Golden ColorCholesterol FreeChemical residue freeGood for immune systemGood Agricultural PracticesIngredientsGolden RaisinsCare InstructionsMust keep it airtight & refrigerated for optimum freshnessAny Other Must-Know Information Constipation:When ingested, raisins swell because the fiber present in them has shrunk in a raisins dried form, but it will begin to swell due to the bodys natural fluids. This adds bulk to the food moving through the intestinal tract and ultimately helps provide relief from constipation. The type of fiber in raisins is considered insoluble fiber because it takes in water and gains volume in that way.  Weight Gain:Raisins, like all dried fruits, are very good tools for gaining weight in a healthy way, since they are full of fructose and glucose and contain a lot of potential energy. They form an ideal part of a diet for athletes or bodybuilders who need powerful boosts of energy, or for those who want to put on weight without accumulating unhealthy amounts of cholesterol. Cancer Prevention:Raisins have high levels of the catechist, which are polyphenolic antioxidants in the blood. Antioxidants scavenge the free radicals that float around the body and wreak havoc on the organ systems and cells. Free radicals are one of the primary, underlying factors that lead to the spontaneous growth of cancer cells, as well as the substance that can spur on metastasis. Therefore, by including raisins in your diet and increasing the level of these powerful antioxidants in your system, you can prevent cancer from forming, or slow down its progress if you have already developed a number of forms of that deadly disease. Hypertension:For many years, some people have believed that raisins have the power to reduce blood pressure and protect the integrity of heart health, but it was only recently that experts began intensive studies on these claims. The findings, although still not absolutely definitive on how raisins reduced blood pressure, did show a positive correlation between reduced hypertension and consumption of raisins. Many of the nutrients packed into raisins are beneficial, but experts believe that it is the high level of potassium that helps with this condition. Potassium is a well-researched way to reduce the tension of blood vessels and decrease blood pressure, and the dietary fiber in raisins is also thought to affect the biochemistry of blood vessels and reduce their stiffness, which in turn reduces hypertension. Diabetes:In a number of studies, raisins have been shown to lower the postprandial insulin response, which means that after eating a meal, they can help the spikes or plunges in insulin levels that can be so dangerous to patients with diabetes. It modulates the sugar absorption by the body, making it more even and stable, reducing the chance of health complications or emergencies for those suffering from both major types of diabetes. They also help to regulate the release of leptin and ghrelin, which are the hormones responsible for telling the body when it is hungry or full. By keeping these hormones in check, people who eat raisins can improve their chances of maintaining a healthy diet and prevent overeating, which further improves their chances of living comfortably with diabetes!Anemia: Raisins contain a considerable amount of iron which directly helps in the treatment of anaemia. It also contains many members of the vitamin B complex that are essential for the formation of new blood. The high copper content in raisins also helps the formation of red blood cells. Fever: Phenolic Phytonutrients, well known for their germicidal, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties, are abundantly present in raisins and can help cure fevers by fighting viral and bacterial infections. Eye Care:Raisins contain polyphenolic phytonutrients which have antioxidant properties. These phytonutrients are very good for ocular health, as they protect the eyes from the damage caused by free radicals (oxidants), in the form of muscular degeneration, age-related weakening of vision, and cataracts. In addition to their antioxidant qualities, raisins contain significant amounts of vitamin A, A-Beta Carotene, and A-Carotenoid, all of which are essential for good ocular health. Bone Health: Calcium, which is the main element of our bones, is present in raisins, and these dried fruits are also one of the best sources of Boron, a micro-nutrient. For those of you who dont know, a micronutrient is a nutrient required by the body in a very small amount as compared to other nutrients that must be consumed daily in significant amounts. Boron is vital for proper bone formation and efficient absorption of calcium. Boron is particularly helpful in preventing osteoporosis induced by menopause in women and has been shown to be very beneficial for bones and joints. Potassium is another essential nutrient found in high levels in raisins which can help strengthen bones and promote bone growth, thereby reducing the chances of osteoporosis in all types of people. Dental Care: Oleanolic Acid, one of the phytochemicals present in raisins, plays a crucial role in protecting your teeth against tooth decay, cavities, and teeth brittleness. It effectively prevents the growth of Streptococcus Mutans and Porphyromonas Gingivalis, two of the bacterial species that are most responsible for cavities and other dental problems. In addition, it is rich in calcium which is good for promoting dental health, as it prevents breaking or peeling away of teeth and enamel while making them stronger. In addition to its role in bone health and osteoporosis treatment, the boron present in raisins plays a very important role in curbing the growth of oral germs as well as in promoting strong teeth. Other Benefits: The fibers in raisins also help promote the excretion of bile from the body, and it stimulates the burning of cholesterol, thereby promoting good cardiac health. Furthermore, the amount of fiber in them helps to literally sweep out the toxins and harmful materials in the digestive tract, which can protect people from additional intestinal diseases, and bacterial growth that is eliminated when the toxins are swept out.About the BrandChandrakranti Farms, having more than two decades of experience in the production and supply of quality fruits and dry fruits.

For every cup of rice,add 2 1/2 of cups of water and cook it by steaming process under low flamewithout any weight on the cooker. An electric rice cooker is also very ideal for steaming. It takesaround 40-45 minutes by this method. Alternatively soak every cup of washed rice in 1 3/4 of water for 1 hour. Cook this without changing the water in a pressure cooker or on a microwave like you cook your regular rice. Increase the number of whistles to let the rice cook well.Cooked Brown Rice does not retain the grain shape like white rice. Due to pressure the outer bran ruptures and the grain opens along the longer axis. This is a characteristic of Brown Rice. The rice is non-sticky but still soft and chewy. It carries the taste of dals and curries very well.The above is based on a 650 watt microwave.

And Nestlé accepted the challenge.Our coffee specialist, Max Morgenthaler, was on a mission to create a delicious cup of coffee simply by adding water. Max and his team worked hard to find a new way to make instant coffee that would retain the coffees natural flavour. In 1938, they found the answer, and NESCAFÉ was born. Named by using the first three letters in Nestlé and suffixing it with café, NESCAFÉ became the new name in coffee. Up until the 1960s NESCAFÉ was only available in tins. Then in 1961, they launched our very first glass jar, in Japan. It was a huge success and helped position NESCAFÉ as a premium product. So in 1962, we decided to launch the glass jar in Europe too. This 1930s Swiss newspaper advert played on the speed and ease of making a NESCAFÉ. And it worked. NESCAFÉ was an instant success. Never before had making coffee been so convenient, fast and easy. "
